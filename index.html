    <h1>${number1} apples from ${mainCharacter}</h1>
    <h2>That’s how ${peopleListWithComa} celebrated ${mainCharacter}’s Bday.</h2>
    <p>
        When my grandson, ${mainCharacter}, told his mother, ${people[0]}, to donate any check she would give him for his ${number1}st ${specialDay}, ${people[0]} got an idea. She handed ${mainCharacter}’s brother ${people[1]} a video camera. Then she took out ${number1} $${number2} bills from the bank and bought ${number1} apples at the supermarket. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When they spotted a homeless man, ${people[0]} told him, “Today is my son ${mainCharacter}’s ${number1}st ${specialDay}, and he asked me to give a gift to someone to help him celebrate.” She handed the man a $${number2} bill and an apple. The man smiled into the camera and announced, “Happy ${specialDay}, ${mainCharacter}!” 
    </p>
    <p>
        Soon, they passed out their booty to men and women waiting in line at a soup kitchen. In a unified chorus, they wished ${mainCharacter}, “Happy ${specialDay}!” 
    </p>
    <p>
        At a pizza parlor, ${people[0]} left $${number3} and told the owners to feed the hungry. “Happy ${specialDay}, ${mainCharacter}!” they shouted. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With one last $${number2} bill and apple, they stopped at ${people[0]}’s sister’s office. Unable to contain her laughter or her tears, she bellowed into the camera, “Happy ${specialDay}, ${mainCharacter}!”
